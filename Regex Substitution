PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The re.sub() tool (sub stands for substitution) evaluates a pattern and, for each valid match, it calls a method (or lambda).
The method is called for all matches and can be used to modify strings in different ways. The re.sub() method returns the modified string as an output.
Task:
You are given a text of N lines. The text contains && and || symbols.
Your task is to modify those symbols to the following:
&& → and
|| → or
Both && and || should have a space ” ” on both sides.

Input format:
The first line contains the integer, N.
The next N lines each contain a line of the text.

Constraints:
0 < N < 100
Neither && nor || occur in the start or end of each line.

SOLUTION:

import re
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = re.sub("(?<=\s)&&(?=\s)", "and", input())
    print(re.sub("(?<=\s)\|\|(?=\s)", "or", s))
