PROBLEM STATEMENT:

ABC is a right triangle, 90o at B. Therefore, angle ABC = 90o. Point M is the midpoint of hypotenuse AC.
You are given the lengths AB and BC.
Your task is to find angle MBC(angle theta, as shown in figure) in degrees.

Input Format:
The first line contains the length of side AB.
The second line contains the length of side BC.

Constraints:
0 < AB <= 100
0 < BC <= 100
Lengths AB and BC are natural numbers.

Output Format:
Output angle MBC in degrees.
Note: Round the angle to the nearest integer.

SOLUTION:

from math import degrees, atan2
AB = float(input())
BC = float(input())
MBC = round(degrees(atan2(AB, BC)))
print((str(MBC)), chr(176), sep='')
