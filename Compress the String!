PROBLEM STATEMENT:

In this task, we would like for you to appreciate the usefulness of the groupby() function of itertools. You are given a string  S. Suppose a character C occurs consecutively X times in the string. Replace these consecutive occurrences of the character C with (X, C) in the string.
For a better understanding of the problem, check the explanation.

Input Format:
A single line of input consisting of the string S.

Output Format:
A single line of output consisting of the modified string.

Constraints:
All the characters of S denotes integers between 0  and 9.
1 <= | S | <= 10^4

SOLUTION:

from itertools import groupby
if __name__ == "__main__":
    for k, c in groupby(input()):
        print("(%d, %d)" % (len(list(c)), int(k)), end=' ')
